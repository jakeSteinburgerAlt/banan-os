# banan-os + ðŸ§ 
.
I've been watching banan-os for a little while and I wanted to contribute. I know too little about kernel dev to not ruin it, but I do machine learning for a living, sooooooo... I'm writing a neural network library from scratch to run on banan-os.

It's still in progress, and I don't even know if it'll train on banan-os or just run a pre-trained model, but I **will** get *something* working. While it can't actually be used yet, once it's done there'll be a startnetwork command in banan-os plus a few input parameters. I'll put docs later on how to use it.
